Ideas
-----------------------------------------------
11) Scrape preferences from Facebook
    - cut down activation energy
    - might not necessarily be representative of current tastes
    - requires facebook account
    - not everyone has artists listed

12) Multiple stations
    - provides a way to save different groups

13) Link with spotify or last.fm?
    - not always applicable
    - ties user to another account
    - reduces need for configuration

14)* Adhoc / Location Based Stations
    - cuts down on activation energy
    - fun, technical challenge

15) Upvote / Downvote
    - requires more active participation
    - greater sense of control

16) Crowdsourced skipping?
    - requires more active participation
    - gives users a feeling that their voice is heard
    - greater sense of control

17) Host has ultimate control
    - probably

18)* Act as "glue" app
    - combine last.fm (official api), spotify (c bindings only), pandora (unofficial api), grooveshark (official api), rdio (official api) data to remove needed activation energy

19) Song updates via chrome extension -- skipping

20) Tie a song to a person or group of people
